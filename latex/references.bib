The hypothesis evaluated here is that intermediate levels of representation, because they can be shared across tasks and examples from different but related distributions, can yield even more benefits. Comparative experiments were performed on a large-scale handwritten character recognition setting with 62 classes (upper case, lower case, digits), using both a multi-task setting and perturbed examples in order to obtain out-of-distribution examples. The results agree with the hypothesis, and show that a deep learner did beat previously published results and reached human-level performance.},

  abstract = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher-level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution P(x)P(x)P(x) is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting P(y{\textbar}x)P(y{\textbar}x)P(y{\textbar}x). This paper focuses on the context of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution.},

  abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed ``DeepLab'' system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.},

  abstract = {Persistence of oil floating in the ocean is an important factor for evaluating hydrocarbon fluxes from natural seeps and anthropogenic releases into the environment. The objective of this work is to estimate the surface residence-time of the oil slick and to determine the importance of wind and surface currents on the trajectory and fate of the released oil. Oil slicks released from natural hydrocarbon seeps located in Green Canyon 600 lease block and its surrounding region in the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed. A Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm was used to delineate georectified polygons for oil slicks from 41 synthetic aperture radar images. Trajectories of the oil slicks were investigated by employing a Lagrangian particle-tracking surface oil drift model. A set of numerical simulations was performed by increasing hindcast interval in reverse time order from the image collection time in order to obtain the closest resemblance between the simulated oil pathways and the length and shape of the oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar images. The average surface residence-time predicted from the hindcast modeling was 6.4h ({\textpm}5.7h). Analysis of a linear regression model, including observed oil slick lengths and variables of wind, surface current, and their relative direction, indicated a statistically significant negative effect of wind speed on the surface oil drift. Higher wind speed ({$>$}7ms-1) reduced length of the oil slicks. When wind and surface currents were driving forces of the surface oil drift model, a good agreement between simulated trajectories and subsequent satellite observations (R2=0.9) suggested that a wind scaling coefficient of 0.035 and a wind deflection angle of 20{$^\circ$} to the right of the wind direction were acceptable approximations for modeling wind effects in this study. Results from the numerical experimentation were supported by in situ observations conducted by a wind-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SailDrone). Results indicated that the surface currents are, indeed, responsible for stretching oil slicks and that surface winds are largely responsible for the disappearance of the oil slicks from the sea surface. Under conditions of low wind and strong current, natural seeps can produce oil slicks that are longer than 20km and persist for up to 48h.},

Reflectance anomalies associated with the slicks have been detected visually on film data, by photo-optical enhancement techniques and by computer processing. Applications of Landsat oil slick data include environmental monitoring of coastal waters and detection of natural seeps such as in the Santa Barbara Channel, which may serve as a worldwide exploration aid.INTRODUCTION. In recognition of the potential benefits of an oil detection capability by Earth resources satellites, the National Environmental Satellite Service of NOAA and the Earth Resources Observations System (EROS) Program Office of the U. S. Geological Survey, both independently and in collaboration with NASA, engaged in studies of oil slick detection from Landsat-l and -2 data. A demonstrated capability to detect oil floating on inland and coastal waters could result in two potentially important applications:Environmental - to detect and delineate oil spills, and thus be used to guide cleanup operations.Exploration - to detect floating oil that originated from onshore or submarine seeps, indicative of a source reservoir of petroleum.Since the launch of the first Earth Resources Technology Satellite (since renamed.},

In order to investigate the composition of natural film and its effect on radar return, in situ samples of the surface microlayer were for the first time taken simultaneously with ERS-1 SAR coverage of the sea. Our results show that the film was enriched in organic composition and that the concentration of fatty acids was generally one order of magnitude higher inside than outside natural film areas, resulting in a 6--17 dB decrease in radar backscatter.},

The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous, but limited to certain observational conditions and simple applications. Infrared cameras offer some potential as oil spill sensors but have several limitations. Both techniques, although limited in capability, are widely used because of their increasing economy. The laser fluorosensor uniquely detects oil on substrates that include shoreline, water, soil, plants, ice, and snow. New commercial units have come out in the last few years. Radar detects calm areas on water and thus oil on water, because oil will reduce capillary waves on a water surface given moderate winds. Radar provides a unique option for wide area surveillance, all day or night and rainy/cloudy weather. Satellite-carried radars with their frequent overpass and high spatial resolution make these day--night and all-weather sensors essential for delineating both large spills and monitoring ship and platform oil discharges. Most strategic oil spill mapping is now being carried out using radar. Slick thickness measurements have been sought for many years. The operative technique at this time is the passive microwave. New techniques for calibration and verification have made these instruments more reliable.},

The images showing natural (biogenic) surface slicks as well as man-made (anthropogenic) mineral oil spills were analyzed with the aim to study whether or not active radar techniques can be applied to discriminating between these two kinds of surface films. Controlled slick experiments were carried out during both shuttle missions in the German Bight of the North Sea as well as in the northern part of the Sea of Japan and the Kuroshio Stream region, where surface films of different viscoelastic properties were deployed within the swath of the shuttle radars. The results show that the damping behavior of the same substance is strongly dependent on wind speed. At high wind speed (8--12 m/s) the ratio of the radar backscatter from a slick-free and a slick-covered water surface (damping ratio) is smaller than at low to moderate wind speeds (4--7 m/s). At 12 m/s, only slight differences in the damping behavior of different substances were measured by SIR-C/X-SAR. Furthermore, several SAR scenes from various parts of the world's oceans showing radar signatures of biogenic as well as anthropogenic surface films at low to moderate wind speeds are analyzed. The damping behavior of these different kinds of oceanic surface films varies particularly at Lband where the biogenic surface films exhibit larger damping characteristics. Results of polarimetric studies from multipolarization SAR images showing various surface films are presented. It can be delineated from these results that Bragg scattering as well as specular reflection contribute to the backscattered radar signal at low incidence angles (up to 30{$^\circ$}). It is concluded that at low to moderate wind speeds, multifrequency radar techniques seem to be capable of discriminating between the different surface films, whereas at high wind conditions a discrimination seems to be difficult.},

For this study, we used the Texture Classifier Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA) to interpret SAR data from the RADARSAT satellite and a geostatistical clustering analysis to compare seeps detected in 579 SAR images covering the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Geostatistical analysis results indicate that, in a typical active seep formation, oil vents would be found within a seep formation {$\sim$}2.5km in diameter. Repeated observations of slicks at a given seep formation indicate that advection of rising oil in the water column causes an offset from the vent depending on water depth. At 500m, the radial offset is up to 1400m; at 2000m, it is up to 3270m. Observations with submersibles showed that, in 100\% of the cases, the calculated seep formations that are matched with active oil seeps correspond to anomalies interpreted from surface amplitude maps and migration pathways in the seismic data. However, episodically, larger releases from persistent seeps occurred, and also some other seep formations showed intermittent releases. Our analysis indicates that active oil seeps detected with SAR represent a subset of the total array of geophysical features generated by hydrocarbon migration on the northern continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4--5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear. The library is already in wide use in research, industry, and teaching.},

Using SAR imagery and the geoinformation (GIS) approach as well as bathymetric data and additional geological and geophysical information, oil seeps can be detected from space, their real position on the sea bottom determined, and additional information about the activity, frequency and volume of oil emissions obtained. As a result, regional oil and gas potential can be confirmed. This methodical approach can be used to search and detect similar phenomena in the seas worldwide, and the detection of new hydrocarbon sources using satellite images once again confirms its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a spaceborne tool allowing near real-time imagery over large ground footprints of areas hundreds of kilometres wide. SAR also allows persistent observations of the process of oil discharges, benefiting from (1) day and night observations, (2) independence of cloud cover and (3) high revisiting frequencies. The interpretation of 82 SAR scenes over the Lower Congo Basin for the 1994--2012 period allowed the recognition of 1400 natural seepage slicks associated with 102 individual seep sites. We acquired an additional SAR data set with a short revisit time over a selected prolific area. The data set consisted of 22 SAR scenes acquired over a 10-day period, meaning a maximum revisiting period of 12h between subsequent SAR acquisitions. The short-term approach shows that seepage slicks were detected with wind speeds between 1.5 and 6.5m/s (2.91 to 12.63knots). Both long-term and short-term monitoring evidences that seepage events are intermittent, with the occurrence rate of oil release ranging from 5 to 80\%. Short-term monitoring shows that the seepage pace is independent between seep sites, suggesting contrasted controlling factors. It also shows that the residence time of seepage slicks is systematically shorter than 12h, which is far below reported values. Understanding the seepage slick residence time is essential to provide an accurate estimation of the fluid flow and to compute the volumetric outflow. The integration of in-situ mooring points measuring the current velocity 10m below the sea surface, in addition to local wind field and slick length, allowed us to more accurately estimate the residence time of oil slicks at the sea surface before vanishing. The results show that the sea surface residence time of oil slicks is limited to a few hours, with a median value of 3h15min. These new residence time estimations allowed us to propose a quantification of the regional oil output in the Lower Congo Basin, estimated at 4380m3/year. This area may therefore be considered as the world's third biggest oil-supplying province from natural leakages.},

The temporal analysis of this system shows that most oil seeps are detected during the summer period, probably due to better detection conditions during this period. The estimations of expulsion frequency computed using the summer period show that the frequency is highly variable from one seep to another with occurrence rates that reach 40\% for the most active sites. Oil seeps gather among two main provinces. First, in the Limnos and Saros pull-apart basins where oil seeps are aligned along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), which suggest that oil seep locations are mostly driven by the fault network. In the Limnos basin, detected oil seeps also coincide with the location of a gravity-driven sedimentary destabilisation complex that developed under the influence of the Limnos pull-apart basin subsidence and the transtensive strain of the NAF. Finally, oil seeps detected in the proximity of the Skyros-Edremit region seems to follow a different control considering that oil seeps appear disconnected from the main fault in the area (Skyros-Edremit).},

To determine the separability of these two varying but similar appearing low backscatter ocean surfaces, multipolarization features are utilized from both SAR datasets. The discrimination is evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test. All imagery was obtained during several sea ice campaigns in the Arctic Ocean and separate oil spill campaigns in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico, with each campaign collecting in situ observations. We observe that the polarization difference (VV-HH) reliably separates the mineral oil slicks and newly formed sea ice areas using UAVSAR images, due to the low noise floor and subsequent high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiometric performance of the airborne system. The comparably higher noise floor and related lower SNR hampers the separability in the RS-2 images. Simulated noise floors were generated by adding white Gaussian noise to the UAVSAR data, which show that discrimination between the two low backscatter phenomena using multipolarization features is possible, provided that both datasets are still well above the noise floor. The pixel resolution has a limited effect on the separability. The results of this study provide an approach to distinguish oil slicks from newly formed sea ice, which might be of special interest should an oil spill occur within the marginal ice zone.},

Using the fully polarimetric scenes we calculate four different parameters, co-polarization ratio, polarization difference, scattering entropy, and mean alpha angle. Three pairs of satellite scenes with comparable incidence angles are used. We observe that a combination of the co-polarization ratio and the polarization difference enables us to delineate the spills from their surrounding and also to discriminate the oil spills from the newly formed sea ice. The scattering entropy and the alpha values provide additional information about the scattering mechanisms of sea ice and oil spills.},

The sedimentary succession ranges from the Late Paleozoic and continues throughout most of the Mesozoic. Terrestrial sediments of the Billefjorden Group (Famennian--Visean) are likely to be present, and are overlain by evaporites and carbonates of the Gipsdalen Group (Serpukhovian--Late Artinskian). Most of the Triassic is dominated by deposits from a huge prograding deltaic system building out from the south, SE and east, becoming successively younger towards NW. The system was primarily sourced from the Urals but also partly from mainland Norway and, most probably, from Taimyr. The progradation started in the Late Permian and reached Svalbard in the Early Carnian. The entire delta system was flooded during the regional Early Norian transgression, resulting in the deposition of marine shales of the Flatsalen Formation (Svalbard) and the time-equivalent Akkar Member of the Fruholmen Formation (Barents Sea). The Cretaceous and the Paleogene are, respectively, comprehensively and completely eroded. During the Pliocene--Pleistocene, the entire Barents shelf was a site of repeated glaciations, resulting in extensive erosion. Hydrocarbon source rocks occur at several stratigraphic levels from the Carboniferous to the Jurassic, of which the most important is assumed to be the Lower--Middle Triassic Steinkobbe/Botneheia Formation. The Upper Jurassic Hekkingen Formation, where present, is likely to be immature across the whole area. Potential reservoir rocks are Permian carbonates and siliciclastic rocks of Carboniferous and Mesozoic age.},

A simple form of transfer learning is common in current state-of-the-art computer vision models, i.e., pre-training a model for image classification on the ILSVRC dataset, and then fine-tune on any target task. However, previous systematic studies of transfer learning have been limited and the circumstances in which it is expected to work are not fully understood. In this paper we carry out an extensive experimental exploration of transfer learning across vastly different image domains (consumer photos, autonomous driving, aerial imagery, underwater, indoor scenes, synthetic, close-ups) and task types (semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, keypoint detection). Importantly, these are all complex, structured output tasks types relevant to modern computer vision applications. In total we carry out over 2000 transfer learning experiments, including many where the source and target come from different image domains, task types, or both. We systematically analyze these experiments to understand the impact of image domain, task type, and dataset size on transfer learning performance. Our study leads to several insights and concrete recommendations: (1) for most tasks there exists a source which significantly outperforms ILSVRC'12 pre-training; (2) the image domain is the most important factor for achieving positive transfer; (3) the source dataset should include the image domain of the target dataset to achieve best results; (4) at the same time, we observe only small negative effects when the image domain of the source task is much broader than that of the target; (5) transfer across task types can be beneficial, but its success is heavily dependent on both the source and target task types.},

Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

This allows for multiple methods, oftentimes several thousands, to be evaluated under identical conditions and across time. The highest ranked performance on a problem is referred to as state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, and is used, among other things, as a reference point for publication of new methods. Using the highest-ranked performance as an estimate for SOTA is a biased estimator, giving overly optimistic results. The mechanisms at play are those of multiplicity, a topic that is well-studied in the context of multiple comparisons and multiple testing, but has, as far as the authors are aware of, been nearly absent from the discussion regarding SOTA estimates. The optimistic state-of-the-art estimate is used as a standard for evaluating new methods, and methods with substantial inferior results are easily overlooked. In this article, we provide a probability distribution for the case of multiple classifiers so that known analyses methods can be engaged and a better SOTA estimate can be provided. We demonstrate the impact of multiplicity through a simulated example with independent classifiers. We show how classifier dependency impacts the variance, but also that the impact is limited when the accuracy is high. Finally, we discuss three real-world examples; Kaggle competitions that demonstrate various aspects.},

  abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico is a hydrocarbon-rich region characterized by the presence of floating oil slicks from persistent natural hydrocarbon seeps, which are reliably captured by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging. Improving the state of knowledge of hydrocarbon seepage in the Gulf of Mexico improves the understanding and quantification of natural seepage rates in North America. We used data derived from SAR scenes collected over the Gulf of Mexico from 1978 to 2018 to locate oil slick origins (OSOs), cluster the OSOs into discrete seep zones, estimate the flux of individual seepage events, and calculate seep recurrence rates. In total, 1618 discrete seep zones were identified, primarily concentrated in the northern Gulf of Mexico within the Louann salt formation, with a secondary concentration in the Campeche region. The centerline method was used to estimate flux based on the drift length of the slick (centerline), the slick area, and average current and wind speeds. Flux estimates from the surface area of oil slicks varied geographically and temporally; on average, seep zones exhibited an 11\% recurrence rate, suggesting possible intermittent discharge from natural seeps. The estimated average instantaneous flux for natural seeps is 9.8 mL s-1 (1.9 {\texttimes} 103 bbl yr-1), with an annual discharge of 1.73--6.69 {\texttimes} 105 bbl yr-1 (2.75--10.63 {\texttimes} 104 m3 yr-1) for the entire Gulf of Mexico. The temporal variability of average flux suggests a potential decrease following 1995; however, analysis of flux in four lease blocks indicates that flux has not changed substantially over time. It is unlikely that production activities in the Gulf of Mexico impact natural seepage on a human timescale. Of the 1618 identified seep zones, 1401 are located within U.S. waters, with 70 identified as having flux and recurrence rates significantly higher than the average. Seep zones exhibiting high recurrence rates are more likely to be associated with positive seismic anomalies. Many of the methods developed for this study can be applied to SAR-detected oil slicks in other marine settings to better assess the magnitude of global hydrocarbon seepage.},

  abstract = {Due to climate change, decreasing ice cover and increasing industrial activities, Arctic marine ecosystems are expected to face higher levels of anthropogenic stress. To sustain healthy and productive ocean ecosystems, it is imperative to build baseline data to assess future climatic and environmental changes. Herein, a natural oil seep site offshore western Svalbard (Prins Karls Forland, PKF, 80--100~m water depth), discovered using satellite radar images, was investigated using an extensive multiscale and multisource geospatial dataset collected by satellite, aerial, floating, and underwater platforms. The investigated PKF seep area covers roughly a seafloor area of 30,000~m2 and discharges oil from Tertiary or younger source rocks. Biomarker analyses confirm that the oil in the slicks on the sea surface and from the seep on the seafloor have the same origin. Uranium/Thorium dating of authigenic carbonate crusts indicated that the seep had emanated since the Late Pleistocene when ice sheet melting unlocked the hydrocarbons trapped beneath the ice. The faunal communities at the PKF seep are a mix of typical high latitude fauna and taxa adapted to reducing environments. Remarkably, the inhospitable oil-impregnated sediments were also colonized by abundant infaunal organisms. Altogether, in situ observations obtained at the site provide essential insights into the characteristics of high--latitude oil seeps and can be used as a natural laboratory for understanding the potential impacts of human oil discharge into the ocean.},

  abstract = {The damping ratio has recently been used to indicate the relative internal oil thickness within oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. However, there exists no well-defined and evaluated methodology for calculating the damping ratio. In this study, we review prior work regarding the damping ratio and outline its theoretical and practical aspects. We show that the most often used methodology yields damping ratio values that differ, in some cases significantly, for the same scene. Three alternative methods are tested on multifrequency datasets of verified oil slicks acquired from DLR's F-SAR instrument, NASA's unmanned aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar, and Sentinel-1. All methods yielded similar results regarding relative thickness variations within slick. The proposed damping ratio derivation methods were found to be sensitive to the proportion of oil covered pixels versus open water pixels in the azimuth direction, as well as to the scene size in question. We show that the fully automatable histogram method provides the most consistent results even under challenging conditions. Comparisons between optical imagery and derived damping ratio values using F-SAR data show good agreement between the relatively thicker oil slick areas for the two different types of sensors.},

These slicks are usually observed using SAR imagery and the important task of observing and monitoring these slicks is as of now carried out manually by human operators aggregated with reported release information. In this thesis we propose three separate approaches to simplify and improve this work through the use of image segmentation and deep learning methods. The approaches are trained and tested on a set of Sentinel-1 scenes over the Brage and Norne platforms off the coast of Norway. The best performing approach was shown to be the direct use of the deep learning algorithm Mask R-CNN on the Sentinel-1 scenes. This approach was able to detect 81{\textbackslash}\% of all slicks in the scenes and had an average user's accuracy of 78{\textbackslash}\% and an average producer's accuracy of 73{\textbackslash}\%. The approaches were also shown to have a significantly reduced ability to detect slicks when the local wind speeds were below 2 m/s or above 11.5 m/s and when the daily volume of oil released from the platforms was below around 150 kg.},

In this light, understanding the distribution and contribution of potential geological methane sources is important. Here we present empirical observations of hitherto undocumented, widespread and extensive methane and oil release from geological reservoirs to the Arctic Ocean. Methane fluxes from {$>$}7000 seeps significantly deplete in seawater, but nevertheless reach the sea surface and may transfer to the air. Oil slick emission spots and gas ebullition are persistent across multi-year observations and correlate to formerly glaciated geological structures, which have experienced km-scale glacial erosion that has left hydrocarbon reservoirs partially uncapped since the last deglaciation {\textasciitilde}15,000 years ago. Such persistent, geologically controlled, natural hydrocarbon release may be characteristic of formerly glaciated hydrocarbon-bearing basins which are common across polar continental shelves, and could represent an underestimated source of natural fossil methane within the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous segmentation of multiple organs from different medical imaging modalities is a crucial task as it can be utilized for computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted surgery, and therapy planning. Thanks to the recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance in the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false negatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance during training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based loss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter model parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time gradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false positives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss function on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scans with 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prostate scans, and ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left ventricular. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results of the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used.},

  abstract = {The success of the supervised classification of remotely sensed images acquired over large geographical areas or at short time intervals strongly depends on the representativity of the samples used to train the classification algorithm and to define the model. When training samples are collected from an image or a spatial region that is different from the one used for mapping, spectral shifts between the two distributions are likely to make the model fail. Such shifts are generally due to differences in acquisition and atmospheric conditions or to changes in the nature of the object observed. To design classification methods that are robust to data set shifts, recent remote sensing literature has considered solutions based on domain adaptation (DA) approaches. Inspired by machine-learning literature, several DA methods have been proposed to solve specific problems in remote sensing data classification. This article provides a critical review of the recent advances in DA approaches for remote sensing and presents an overview of DA methods divided into four categories: 1) invariant feature selection, 2) representation matching, 3) adaptation of classifiers, and 4) selective sampling. We provide an overview of recent methodologies, examples of applications of the considered techniques to real remote sensing images characterized by very high spatial and spectral resolution as well as possible guidelines for the selection of the method to use in real application scenarios.},

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1},

  abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},
